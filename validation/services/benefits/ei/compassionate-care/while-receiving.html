      <h3>Working while receiving compassionate care benefits</h3>
      <p>You cannot work full time while receiving  compassionate care benefits. However, you are entitled to work part time and  keep a portion of your benefits.</p>
      <p> Normally, if you work and receive compassionate care  benefits at the same time, you are entitled to earn a certain amount without  having your benefits reduced. You can usually earn up to <strong>$50 per week or 25 percent</strong> of your weekly benefit, whichever is  higher. Any money earned above that amount will be deducted dollar for dollar  from your benefit.</p>
      <p> However, until August 11, 2018, a <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/ei/information/wwc.shtml">Working  While on Claim (WWC)</a> pilot project is in place which changes the way  earnings are deducted.</p>
      <p> Under this <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/ei/information/wwc.shtml">pilot project</a>,  once you have served the waiting period, if your earnings are equal to or less  than 90% of your weekly earnings that were used to calculate your benefit rate,  your benefits will be reduced at a rate of 50% of your earnings each week. Any  earnings that exceed this 90% threshold, will be deducted dollar for dollar  from your benefits.</p>
      <p> You must report all gross earnings—before taxes and  deductions—during the week you earn them, as well as any other money you may  receive while collecting compassionate care benefits. To report your earnings,  simply call the EI Telephone Information Service at <strong>1-800-206-7218</strong> (TTY: 1-800-529-3742) from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,  Monday to Friday, and press "0" to speak with a representative. You  can also write to us at your local <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/sc-srch.cgi?ln=eng">Service  Canada Centre</a>, or you can visit us in person there.</p>

    <h2>Rights and responsibilities</h2>
    <p>The EI program guarantees certain rights. There are also some basic  responsibilities, for both you and Service Canada.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>You have the right to:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>file a claim for EI benefits;</li>
      <li>receive any benefits that are owing to you;</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-reconsideration.html">request  a reconsideration</a> of any decisions we make about your benefits that  you find unsatisfactory;</li>
      <li>see any government record that contains your  personal information; and</li>
      <li>be served in the official language of your  choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a <strong>claimant</strong> of EI benefits,  your <strong>responsibilities</strong> include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>provide an authorization to release a medical  certificate and a medical certificate completed by a doctor or other medical  practitioner indicating that your ill family member has a significant risk of  death within the next 26 weeks (six months) and requires your care and support; </li>
      <li>provide all required information and documents; </li>
      <li>notify Service Canada of any situation that may  arise which could affect EI benefits; for example, if your gravely ill family  member dies or recovers; </li>
      <li>report all employment, whether you work for  someone else or yourself; </li>
      <li>accurately report all employment earnings before  deductions, in the week(s) in which they were earned, as well as any other  monies you may receive; </li>
      <li>decide with other eligible family members who  will serve the waiting period if compassionate care, parental or benefits for  parents of critically ill children are shared. </li>
      <li>inform us whether you or the other parent  request benefits for parents of critically ill children if the gravely ill  family member is a critically ill child.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Your employer </strong>
    </p>
    <p> If we decide to pay you benefits even if you quit, were fired for  misconduct, refused work, or are involved in a labour dispute, we will notify  your employer. If an employer believes that our decision is not justified, he  or she can request a reconsideration of that decision.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Service Canada's responsibilities</strong>
    </p>
    <p> At Service Canada, we are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>giving  you prompt and courteous service;</li>
      <li>advising  you of the programs and services that are available to you;</li>
      <li>serving  you in the official language of your choice;</li>
      <li>determining  if you are eligible to receive benefits—that is, whether or not you meet the  qualifying conditions specified in the <em>Employment  Insurance Act</em> and Regulations—and determining how many weeks of benefits  you can receive;</li>
      <li>processing  all claims within the same timeframe;</li>
      <li>issuing  your first payment no later than 28 days after the date we receive your application,  if you have provided us with all the required information and if you are  eligible for benefits;</li>
      <li>giving you accurate information about your claim, including how you       can share parental benefits with your EI-eligible spouse or partner and       compassionate care benefits with other EI-eligible family members, and whether       or not you will need to serve a   one-week waiting period; and</li>
      <li>letting  you know about decisions we've made about your claim and explaining the process  to follow if you disagree with a decision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Protecting Employment Insurance—with your help</h2>
    <p>Service Canada works to protect the EI program from misuse. One of the ways  we do this is by working with employers and claimants to ensure the accuracy of  the information we receive. With your help, we can reduce the amount of misuse  and ensure that the EI program is used as it should be—as a program that  provides temporary financial assistance to individuals who qualify.</p>
    <p> A mistake is an unintentional act. We know claimants can make mistakes when  filing their reports. Common mistakes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>estimating  weekly earnings instead of putting in the actual amount earned;</li>
      <li>declaring  net earnings instead of gross earnings;</li>
      <li>forgetting  to declare all the earnings received;</li>
      <li>writing  or entering the wrong number when reporting earnings; or</li>
      <li>adding  the number of hours or amount of earnings incorrectly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some mistakes can delay benefit payments, while others can affect the amount  of benefits you receive—meaning you were paid more or less than you were  entitled to receive.</p>
    <p> For example, estimating your earnings can have the following effects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If  you estimated your earnings for one week and your estimate was higher than the  earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be less than it should  have been. If this happens, let us know and we will adjust your file to make  sure you receive all the benefits to which you are entitled.</li>
      <li>If  you estimated your earnings for one week and your estimate was lower than the  earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be higher than it  should have been. Let us know if this happens. You will have to repay the  excess amount, but we will ensure that repaying it causes no undue hardship. As  well, we will adjust your file to reflect your accurate information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you notice a mistake on a completed form or report, or if there is a  change in your circumstances that could affect your EI claim, tell Service  Canada immediately. This will help prevent any future problems with your claim.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Misrepresentation</h2>
    <p>If you knowingly withhold information, make misleading statements, or  misrepresent the facts to make a false claim for benefits, this is considered  misrepresentation. You could face severe monetary penalties or prosecution.  This could also affect your future benefits. However, if you disclose your  actions to Service Canada before an investigation begins, we may waive any  monetary penalties and prosecutions that might otherwise apply.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Consequences of misrepresentation</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Interest on debt</h4>
        <p>When EI claimants receive benefits to which they are not entitled, the  amount of the overpayment counts as a debt that must be repaid.</p>
        <p> Service Canada charges interest on this debt when it results from claimants  who knowingly withhold information or make false or misleading representations  or statements. However, we do not charge interest on debt that results when  Service Canada makes an error in the benefit payment.</p>
        <p> The rate of interest is the Bank of Canada average rate plus 3%. Interest is  calculated daily and compounded monthly.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Penalties</h4>
        <p>A penalty may be imposed on a claimant, an employer, or an individual acting  on their behalf in relation to a claim for benefits when he or she has:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>knowingly  made false or misleading representations or statements; or</li>
          <li>completed  a statement without declaring essential information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is an example of a situation where penalties may be imposed:</p>
        <p> An EI benefit claimant goes on an ocean cruise for a month and arranges for  a friend to conceal their absence by signing and returning two EI claimant  reports. As a result, the claimant illegally received $350 in benefits for each  of the four weeks of the cruise. After investigation, we find that this was the  first time the claimant and the friend had misused the EI system. As well, we  find that they both knew that what they did was illegal but they did it anyway.</p>
        <p> In this case, the claimant will have to repay $1,400 (four weeks of benefits  at $350 per week) and may have to pay a penalty of $700 ($350 for each of the  two false reports filed during the holiday). The friend may also have to pay a  penalty of $700 for the illegal act of filing two false reports on behalf of  the claimant.</p>
        <p> There are many situations when a penalty may apply, and the amount could  become very high. Depending on the circumstances, the maximum penalty could be  up to three times the amount of the overpayment, three times the weekly benefit  rate for each incident of misrepresentation, or three times the maximum benefit  rate.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Violations</h2>
    <p>Claimants who misuse the EI program and were assessed a violation may need  more insurable earnings or hours to qualify for benefits in the future. The  required amount rises based on the number and seriousness of misrepresentations  that have been recorded in the five-year period before the start of their  claims. </p>
